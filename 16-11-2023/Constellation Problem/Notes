Three characters { #, *, . } represents a constellation of stars and galaxies in space. Each galaxy is demarcated by # characters. There can be one or many stars in a given galaxy. Stars can only be in the shape of vowels { A, E, I, O, U }. A collection of * in the shape of the vowels is a star. A star is contained in a 3×3 block. Stars cannot be overlapping. The dot(.) character denotes empty space.

Given 3xN matrix comprising of { #, *, . } character, find the galaxy and stars within them.

Note: Please pay attention to how vowel A is denoted in a 3×3 block in the examples section below.

Constraints

3 <= N <= 10^5
Input

Input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of columns.
Output

The output contains vowels (stars) in order of their occurrence within the given galaxy. The galaxy itself is represented by the # character.
Example 1

Input

18

* . * # * * * # * * * # * * * . * .

* . * # * . * # . * . # * * * * * *

* * * # * * * # * * * # * * * * . *

Output

U#O#I#EA

Explanation

As it can be seen that the stars make the image of the alphabets U, O, I, E, and A respectively.

Example 2

Input

12

* . * # . * * * # . * .

* . * # . . * . # * * *

* * * # . * * * # * . *

Output

U#I#A

Explanation

As it can be seen that the stars make the image of the alphabet U, I, and A.


Solution : 

Find the differences between the representation of the letters A,E,I,O,U.
Using these differences, we can iterate through the first row alone to find the letter by incrementing the index appropriately.
