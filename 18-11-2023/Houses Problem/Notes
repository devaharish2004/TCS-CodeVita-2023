There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it.

 A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbours left and right side.

What is the maximum stolen value?

Sample Input: val[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 5}

Sample Output: 20

Solution :
Since we can leave all the adjacent houses after a robbed house, we need to check two conditions :
1. If the thief starts from index 0
2. If the thief starts from index 1

Thus, check for all odd values and even values in the array and find the maximum value of both.
