Question :
Problem
In a global Mathematics contest, the contestants are told to invent some special numbers which
can be built by adding the squares of its digits. Doing this perpetually, the numbers will end up to
1 or 4.
If a positive integer ends with 1, then it is called the Number of Game.
An example from above is:
13 = 1^2 + 3^2 = 1+9 = 10 (Step:1)
10 = 1^2 + 0^2 = 1+0 = 1 (Step:2), iteration ends in Step 2 since number ends with 1
Then in next round, the contestants are asked to combine their newly invented number, i.e.
Number of Game with prime number.
Now, being a smart programmer, write a program to help the contestants to find out the Nth
the combined number within any given range, where N can be any integer.
Input Format:
Input consists of 3 integers X, Y, N, one on each line. X and Y are upper and lower limits of the
range. The range is inclusive of both X and Y. Find the Nth number in the range [X, Y].
Line 1 X, where X is the upper limit of the range
Line 2 Y, where Y is the lower limit of the range
Line 3 N, where the Nth element of the series is required
Constraints:
X <= Y
X > 0
N > 0
Output Format:
The output will show the Nth element of the combined series lying in the range between X and Y.
Line 1
For Valid Input, print
U, where U is the Nth element of the combined number series lying in the range between X and Y.
Or
No number is present at this index
For Invalid Input,print Invalid Input

Input : 
1 30 
3 
Output :
19

Solution :
First find all the numbers which are having the sum of squares as 1, then find if the number is prime. If both are satisfied then that number can be considered as an answer.
