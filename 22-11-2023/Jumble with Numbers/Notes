In NASA, two researchers, Mathew and John, started their work on a new planet, but while practicing research they faced a mathematical difficulty. In order to save the time they divided their work.
So scientist Mathew worked on a piece and invented a number computed with the following formula:
A Mathew number is computed as follows using the formula:
H(n) = n(2n-1)
And scientist John invented another number which is built by the following formula which is called John number.
T(n) = n(n+1)/2
Now Mathew and John are jumbled while combining their work. Now help them combine their research work by finding out number in a given range that satisfies both properties. Using the above formula, the first few Mathew-John numbers are:
1 6 15 28 â€¦

Input Format:

Input consists of 3 integers T1,T2,M separated by space . T1 and T2 are upper and lower limits of the range. The range is inclusive of both T1 and T2. Find Mth number in range [T1,T2] which is actually a Mathew-John number.


Line 1	T1 T2 M,where T1 is upper limit of the range, T2 is lower limit of the range and M ,where Mth element of the series is required

Constraints:

0 < T1 < T2 < 1000000

Output Format:

Print Mth number from formed sequence between T1 and T2(inclusive).

Solution :
John number represents the sum of numbers till n sequence, and Mathew number represents the odd values present in that sequence.

Sum of numbers = 1,3,6,10,15,21,28,...
Mathew numbers and John Numbers = 1,6,15,28,....

Thus, the sum of numbers formula is enough for calculating the combined numbers between the range.
